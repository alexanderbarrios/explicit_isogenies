# Code for explicit isogenies
This repository contains the code that verifies some of the results of the paper *Explicit classification of isogeny graphs of rational elliptic curves* by Alexander Barrios. The codes are written by the author as well.


This code was written on SageMath, and the repository consists of 6 files:

(1) models.sage

(2) Isogenies_for_calC.sage

(3) Verification_of_calC.ipynb

(4) Verification_of_Lemma_3_3.ipynb

(5) Section_4.ipynb

(6) Verification_of_Lemma_5_3.ipynb

File (1) and (2) contain the definitions that are called by (3), (4), (5), and (6).

File (3) verifies Proposition 3.1 and Remark 3.2.

File (4) verifies Lemma 3.3.

File (5) verifies the results in Section 4.

File (6) verifies Lemma 5.3.
